Contains sample of design patterns I've previously implemented and study notes for future references

----
`S | SRP | Single Responsibility Principle`
- `Definition:` _“Each module should do one thing and do it well.”_

`O | OCP | Open-Closed Principle`
- `Definition:` _“You should be able to use and add to a module without rewriting it.”_

`L | LSP | Liskov Substituion Principle`
- `Definition:` _"You should be able to substitute one thing for another if those things are declared to behave the same way."_

`I | ISP | Interface Segregation Principle`
- `Definition:` _“Don’t show your clients more than they need to see”._

`D | DI | Dependency Inversion`

Conclusion:

To restate “modern SOLID” one more time:

- Don’t surprise the people who read your code.
- Don’t surprise the people who use your code.
- Don’t overwhelm the people who read your code.
- Use sane boundaries for your code.
- Use the right level of coupling—keep things together that belong together, and keep them apart if they belong apart.
